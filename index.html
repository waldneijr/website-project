  <p>Hi everyone, nice to meet you!</p>
  <p>I am an applied technology student. I want to work as a web developer in the future.</p>
  <p>I love literature and music.</p>
  <p>I got married in 02/26/2021. It was the happiest day of my life.</p>
  <p>I study at BYU Idaho. I love this college because it has a huge connection with the gospel of Jesus Christ. I am looking for a bachelor's degree.</p>
  <p>I joined the Church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints last year (09/08/2021). This date is important to me because it's also my wife's birthday.</p>
  <p>That's all by now, thank you for visiting this webpage!</p>
